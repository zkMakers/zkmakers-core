# zkMakers Contracts

zkMakers (Previsouly know as Liquid miners) is a platform where projects or users can obtain rewards in exchange for providing volume or liquidity to a pool of a particular pair. In this way the platform serves to decentralize market making, offering transparent trading for the entire community.

Both trades and orders in the CEX and DEX will be validated by an oracle.

Rewards can be added by anyone, thus incentivizing the pair's activity at any given moment in time.
